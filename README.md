# Coinit

Engineered a cryptocurrency paper trading platform that allows users to simulate real market conditions for 11,000+ coins without risking capital and track profit/losses through a dedicated statistics dashboard. Optimized concurrent server requests by 200% by incorporating rotating proxies to bypass API rate limits leading to improved performance and a better overall user experience. Designed REST APIs using Node.js/Express.js connected to a MongoDB database to allow secure user authentication
Incorporated React (Router, Hooks), ApexCharts, Axios, HTML, and CSS Modules to include real-time market charts and a user-friendly interface
